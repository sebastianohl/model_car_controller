# Model Car remote controller

This project reads input signals from a standard model car receiver and forwards them to servo and motor control. To enable the usage of a grown-up model car by children, the ratio between input and output can be adapted. 

Needed Hardware:
* EPS32S NodeMCU

Configuration:
* use idy.py menuconfig to set parameters (e.g. WiFi Password, MQTT Settings...)

Software:
* ESP-IDF Package
* Visual Studio Code (with dev container support)
